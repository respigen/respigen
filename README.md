You've probably found me through a CV, or I've spoken to you in person. You already know me, but...

- 🫂 I'm most interested in full-stack or front-end development: Anything people-oriented. I like product development.
- 🌏 Skilled in UX, accessibility, and localisation/internationalisation.
- 📐 I'm trying to brush up my skills between roles with the projects you can find on this page. 
- 🛠️ Looking to pick up more languages and tech outside of my previous frontend experience. TODO: C#/.NET, AWS, C++, Rust, iOS development. 

Reach me at `rare.spigen@gmail.com` or however you got here in the first place. If I gave you a CV, use the contract details there.
