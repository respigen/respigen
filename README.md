You've probably found me through a CV, or I've spoken to you in person. You already know me, but...

- 🫂 I'm interested in front-end and full-stack development: Anything people-oriented.
- 🌏 Skilled in accessibility, localisation/internationalisation, and UX.
- 📐 I'm trying to brush up my skills between roles with [little projects](http://respigen.github.io/projects/).
- 📝 [Sometimes I write](http://respigen.github.io/articles/) about my thoughts on development and job miscellania.  
- 🛠️ Trying to pick up C#/.NET and improve my back-end skills. TODO: Rust, Ruby, Go, AWS, iOS development. Maybe something zany like F# or Gleam?

Reach me at `rare.spigen@gmail.com` or however you got here in the first place. If I gave you a CV, use the contract details there.

You should really check out [this page](http://respigen.github.io) where all my projects and articles can be found, though.
